          <h1>How Image Compression Works</h1>
          <p>
            Image compression is a technique used to reduce the file size of
            images while attempting to maintain an acceptable level of visual
            quality. It's essential for various applications like web
            development, digital photography, video streaming, and more, as
            smaller image sizes lead to faster loading times, reduced storage
            requirements, and improved network performance.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Lossless Compression</h2>
          <p>
            Lossless compression reduces the file size without sacrificing any
            image quality. This is achieved by encoding redundant or unnecessary
            data in a more efficient way. Some common lossless compression
            algorithms are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Run-Length Encoding (RLE): Replaces sequences of identical pixels
              with a code that represents the pixel value and the count of
              consecutive occurrences.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW): Identifies repeating patterns in the image
              and replaces them with shorter codes, maintaining a dictionary of
              patterns for efficient encoding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Predictive Coding: Predicts the value of a pixel based on its
              neighboring pixels and encodes the difference between the
              predicted and actual pixel values.
            </li>
            <li>
              Huffman Coding: Assigns shorter codes to more frequent pixel
              values and longer codes to less frequent values, optimizing the
              overall encoding.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Lossy Compression</h2>
          <p>
            Lossy compression achieves higher levels of compression by
            discarding some image data that is deemed less important to human
            perception. This introduces some loss of image quality, but the goal
            is to minimize this loss while significantly reducing file size.
            Common lossy compression techniques include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Quantization: Reduces the number of distinct colors or color
              levels in an image, effectively reducing the amount of data
              required to represent it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chroma Subsampling: Reduces the resolution of color information
              while keeping the brightness information intact, resulting in
              smaller file sizes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT): Converts blocks of pixel data
              into frequency components, allowing for aggressive quantization of
              higher-frequency components.
            </li>
            <li>
              JPEG Compression: Uses DCT, quantization, and Huffman coding to
              achieve high compression rates, making it suitable for
              photographic images.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Choosing Between Lossless and Lossy Compression</h2>
          <p>
            The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the
            application and the acceptable trade-off between image quality and
            file size. Lossless compression is preferred when preserving every
            detail of an image is crucial, such as in medical imaging or graphic
            design. Lossy compression is suitable for scenarios where reducing
            file size is a higher priority than retaining every bit of image
            data, such as web images or social media posts.
